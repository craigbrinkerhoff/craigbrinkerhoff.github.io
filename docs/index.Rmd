My name is Craig Brinkerhoff (he/him) and I am a PhD candidate in the [Fluvial@UMass group](https://blogs.umass.edu/cjgleason/) in Civil/Environmental Engineering at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. My interests are in large-to-global scale modeling and remote sensing of river hydrology and biogeochemistry.

I spend my spare time on music (mostly mandolin), single-origins, trail running, and cycling.
