<p>My work takes a necessarily holistic, multi-scale approach to mapping and measuring surface water quantity and quality. I do this across millions of rivers by leveraging and developing tools from river hydrology, river biogeochemistry, remote sensing, and large-scale geoprocessing.</p>
<p>I’m particularly interested in the emergent phenomena that arise from simultaneously considering hydrology and biogeochemistry at large scales: <strong>how might a broad, ‘bio-geo-morpho-chemical’ approach reveal new knowledge about global surface water health? And what might these findings mean for sustainable freshwater management?</strong></p>
