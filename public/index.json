Iâ€™m a computational hydro-geomorphologist and physical hydrologist interested in large-to-global scale modeling and remote sensing of rivers and (more broadly) drainage networks. My ultimate goal is to explore the downstream impacts of the landscape, rivers, and people.\rIn practice, I develop scalable geomorphic theory within high-performance computational and remote sensing frameworks to better understand the downstream transport of water and solutes. A unique component of my work is leveraging the long and rich tradition of field-scale fluvial geomorphology, hydraulics, and hydrology within large computing projects.\r","date":"17 September 2022","permalink":"/","section":"About Me","summary":"My name is Craig Brinkerhoff and I am a PhD candidate in the Fluvial@UMass group in Civil \u0026amp; Environmental Engineering at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.","title":"About Me"},{"content":"","date":"17 September 2022","permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","date":"17 September 2022","permalink":"/tags/contact/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"contact"},{"content":"\rPlease feel free to reach out to me at cbrinkerhoff@umass.edu!\rFind the repo for this website here.
