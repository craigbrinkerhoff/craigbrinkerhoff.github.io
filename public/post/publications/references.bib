  abstract = {Recent advances in remote sensing and the upcoming launch of the joint NASA/CNES/CSA/UKSA Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite point toward improved river discharge estimates in ungauged basins. Existing discharge methods rely on ``prior river knowledge'' to infer parameters not directly measured from space. Here, we show that discharge estimation is improved by classifying and parameterizing rivers based on their unique geomorphology and hydraulics. Using over 370,000 in situ hydraulic observations as training data, we test unsupervised learning and an ``expert'' method to assign these hydraulics and geomorphology to rivers via remote sensing. This intervention, along with updates to model physics, constitutes a new method we term ``geoBAM,'' an update of the Bayesian At-many-stations hydraulic geometry-Manning's (BAM) algorithm. We tested geoBAM on Landsat imagery over more than 7,500 rivers (108 are gauged) in Canada's Mackenzie River basin and on simulated hydraulic data for 19 rivers that mimic SWOT observations without measurement error. geoBAM yielded considerable improvement over BAM, improving the median Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) for the Mackenzie River from -0.05 to 0.26 and from 0.16 to 0.46 for the SWOT rivers. Further, NSE improved by at least 0.10 in 78/108 gauged Mackenzie rivers and 8/19 SWOT rivers. We attribute geoBAM improvement to parameterizing rivers by type rather than globally, but prediction accuracy worsens if parameters are misassigned. This method is easily mapped to rivers at the global scale and paves the way for improving future discharge estimates, especially when coupled with hydrologic models.},

  abstract = {Lakes are central components of the inland water system distinct from, yet inextricably connected to, river networks. Currently, existing network-scale biogeochemistry research, although robust, typically treats each of these components separately or reductively. Here, we incorporate lake morphometry into a fully connected stream/lake network for the Connecticut River watershed and model potential evasion of terrestrially sourced headwater CO2 as transported through the network, ignoring in-stream production. We found that approximately 25\%\textendash 30\% of total potential soil CO2 evasion occurs in lakes, and percent evasion is inversely related to streamflow. A lake's ability to evade CO2 is controlled by residence time and size: most lakes with residence time over 7 days or surface area greater than 0.004 km2 evade functionally all terrestrial CO2 entering from upstream, precluding further downstream transport. We conclude that lakes are important for soil CO2 degassing and that this coupled river/lake approach is promising for CO2 studies henceforth.},

  abstract = {At-many-stations hydraulic geometry (AMHG), while useful for estimating river discharge from satellite data, remains empirical and has yet to be reconciled with the at-a-station hydraulic geometry (AHG) from which it was originally derived. Here we present evidence, using United States Geological Survey field measurements of channel hydraulics for 155 rivers, that AMHG can be hydraulically and geomorphically reconciled with AHG. Our results indicate that AMHG is rightly understood as an expression of a river-wide model of hydraulics driven by changes in slope imposed upon AHG physics. The explanatory power of AHG and this river-wide model combine to determine whether AMHG exists: if both AHG and the river-wide model adequately describe hydraulics, then we show that AMHG is a necessary mathematical consequence of these two phenomena. We also orient these findings in the context of river discharge estimation and other applications.},

  abstract = {The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission will measure river width, water surface elevation, and slope for rivers wider than 50\textendash 100 m. SWOT observations will enable estimation of river discharge by using simple flow laws such as the Manning-Strickler equation, complementing in situ streamgages. Several discharge inversion algorithms designed to compute unobserved flow law parameters (e.g., friction coefficient and bathymetry) have been proposed, but to date, a systematic assessment of factors controlling algorithm performance has not been conducted. Here, we assess the performance of the five algorithms that are expected to be used in the construction of the SWOT product. To perform this assessment, we used synthetic SWOT observations created with hydraulic model output corrupted with SWOT-like error. Prior information provided to the algorithms was purposefully limited to an estimate of mean annual flow (MAF), designed to produce a ``worst case'' benchmark. Prior MAF error was an important control on algorithm performance, but discharge estimates produced by the algorithms are less biased than the MAF; thus, the discharge algorithms improve on the prior. We show for the first time that accuracy and frequency of remote sensing observations are less important than prior bias, hydraulic variability among reaches, and flow law accuracy in governing discharge algorithm performance. The discharge errors and error sensitivities reported herein are a bounding benchmark, representing worst possible expected errors and error sensitivities. This study lays the groundwork to develop predictive power of algorithm performance, and thus map the global distribution of worst-case SWOT discharge accuracy.},

  abstract = {The relative capacity for watersheds to eliminate or export reactive constituents has important implications on aquatic ecosystem ecology and biogeochemistry. Removal efficiency depends on factors that affect either the reactivity or advection of a constituent within river networks. Here, we characterized Damk\"ohler number (Da) for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) uptake in global river networks. Da equals the advection to reaction timescale ratio and thus provides a unitless indicator for DOC reaction intensity during transport within river networks. We aim to demonstrate the spatial and temporal patterns and interplays among factors that determine DOC uptake across global river networks. We show that watershed size imposes a primary control on river network DOC uptake due to a three orders of magnitude difference in water residence time (WRT) between the smallest and largest river networks. DOC uptake capacity in tropical river networks is 2\textendash 6 times that in temperate and the Arctic river networks, coinciding with larger DOC removals in warm than in cold watersheds. River damming has a profound impact on DOC uptake due to significantly extended WRTs, particularly in temperate watersheds where most constructed dams are situated. Global warming is projected to increase river network DOC uptake by ca. 19\% until year 2100 under the RCP4.5 scenario.},

  abstract = {Sunlight can oxidize dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in freshwaters. The importance of complete photooxidation, or photomineralization, as a sink for DOC remains unclear in temperate rivers, as most estimates are restricted to lakes, high latitude rivers, and coastal river plumes. In this study, we construct a model representing over 75,000 river reaches in the Connecticut River Watershed (CRW), USA, to calculate spectrally resolved photomineralization. We test the hypothesis that photomineralization is a negligible DOC sink across all reaches and flow conditions relative to DOC fluxes. Our model quantifies reaction rates and transport drivers within the river reaches for the ranges of flow conditions, incoming solar irradiance, and canopy cover shading observed throughout the year. Our model predicts average daily areal photomineralization rates ranging from 1.16 mg-C m-2 day-1 in low flow river reaches in the winter, to 18.33 mg-C m-2 day-1 in high flow river reaches during the summer. Even for high photomineralization fluxes, corresponding photomineralization uptake velocities are typically at least an order of magnitude smaller than those reported for other instream processes. We calculate DOC elimination by photomineralization relative to DOC fluxes through individual stream reaches as well as the entire riverine portion of the CRW. We find that relative photomineralization fluxes are highest in summer drought conditions in low order streams. In median flows and mean light intensities, for an average watershed travel distance, 3\%\textendash 5\% of the DOC fluxes are eliminated, indicating that photomineralization is a minor DOC sink in temperate rivers.},
