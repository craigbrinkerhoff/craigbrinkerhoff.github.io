# Introduction
This repo is for my personal website [here](https://craigbrinkerhoff.github.io). It is built using `R`, the `blogdown` package, and `Hugo`. I also used the [sourdough starter template](https://github.com/jack-alope/sourgough-starter) as a jumping off point.

The entire site should be reproducible as a `renv` lockfile is included to reproduce the R packages (and versions) required to build the site.

There are specific `blogdown` settings set up in the `.Rprofile`. Check those out too.
