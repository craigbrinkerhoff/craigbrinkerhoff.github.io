<p>My name is Craig Brinkerhoff and I am a PhD candidate in the <a href="https://blogs.umass.edu/cjgleason/">Fluvial@UMass group</a> in Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. My interests are in large-to-global scale modeling and remote sensing of river network hydrology and biogeochemistry. I use remote sensing, GIS, and theoretical models to study water and carbon cycling along the entire stream-to-ocean continuum. I have particular interest in the role that hydrography plays in understanding river process at scale.
