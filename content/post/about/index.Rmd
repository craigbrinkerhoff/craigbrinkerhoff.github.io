My name is Craig Brinkerhoff and I am a PhD candidate in the [Fluvial@UMass group](https://blogs.umass.edu/cjgleason/) in Civil & Environmental Engineering at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. My interests are in large-to-global scale modeling and remote sensing of river network hydrology and biogeochemistry. I use remote sensing, GIS, and geomorphic/hydrologic theory to explore water and carbon cycling at the catchment-to-global scale. I have a particular interest in the role that hydrography and hydraulic geometry play in understanding river process at scale.
