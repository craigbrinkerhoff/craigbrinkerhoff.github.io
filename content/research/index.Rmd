My work takes a necessarily holistic, multi-scale approach to mapping and measuring surface water quantity and quality. I do this across millions of rivers by leveraging and developing tools from river hydrology, river biogeochemistry, remote sensing, and large-scale geoprocessing.

I'm particularly interested in the emergent phenomena that arise from simultaneously considering hydrology and biogeochemistry at large scales: **how might a broad, 'bio-geo-morpho-chemical' approach reveal new knowledge about global surface water health? And what might these findings mean for sustainable freshwater management?**

## Measuring rivers from space
- What properties of global rivers can we infer from satellite measurements?
- What do these measurements reveal about global hydrology?
- Representative papers:
  - [Constraining remote river discharge estimation using reach-scale geomorphology](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020WR027949)
  - [Inversion of river discharge from remotely sensed river widths: A critical assessment at three-thousand global river gauges](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2023.113489)
  - [Remotely sensing river greenhouse gas exchange velocity using the SWOT satellite](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022GB007419)

## Transporting 'stuff' downstream
- How do organic matter, pollutants, and other solutes move through drainage systems?
- How does geomorphology and hydrology modulate downstream water quality?
- Representative papers:
  - [Lake morphometry and river network controls on evasion of terrestrially sourced headwater CO2](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GL090068)
  - [Watershed DOC uptake occurs mostly in lakes in the summer and in rivers in the winter](https://doi.org/10.1002/lno.12306)
  - [Global controls on DOC reaction versus export in watersheds: A Damkhler number analysis](https://doi.org/10.1029/2021GB007278)

## Mapping the human footprint on global surface waters
- What do the above techniques reveal about human impacts on hydrology?
- How do both physical and political agents impact river water quality globally?
- How far downstream are these impacts felt?
- Representative papers:
