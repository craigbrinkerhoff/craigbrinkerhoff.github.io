Rivers and their riparian corridors are the landscape’s integrators and exert a powerful influence on the ecosystems and communities through which they flow. To understand that influence under ongoing global change, river science must take a broad, integrative approach that draws on multiple disciplines while remaining observation driven.

In that spirit, I develop and integrate AI/ML predictive modeling, satellite remote sensing, and in situ sensing, all while using data fusion methods to integrate information across sensors, sources, and disciplinary perspectives. I have specific interests in river corridor transport processes, hydrologic connectivity, hydraulic geometry, headwater systems, and global monitoring.

## Constraining global river fluxes
- What role do surface waters play in the global cycling of water, nutrients, and sediments?
- What role do humans play in regulating these processes?
- **Representative papers:**
  - [River Metabolism in the Contiguous United States: A West of Extremes](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adu9843)
  - [Accelerating river discharge in High Mountain Asia](https://doi.org/10.1029/2024AV001586)
  - [The importance of hydrology in routing terrestrial carbon to the atmosphere via global streams and rivers](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2106322119)

## Understanding the role of small streams
- How much do the headwaters impact downstream rivers and watershed export?
- What is the extent of headwater streams?
- **Representative papers:**
  - [Ephemeral stream water contributions to United States drainage networks](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adg9430)
  - [Detecting proglacial headwater streams in High Mountain Asia using Planet imagery](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2024.114124)

## Understanding how 'stuff' moves downstream
- How do organic matter, nutrients, and sediments move through watersheds?
- How does hydrological connectivity impact water quantity and quality?
- **Representative papers:**
  - [The importance of source data in river network connectivity modeling: a review](https://doi.org/10.1002/lno.12706)
  - [Global controls on DOC reaction versus export in watersheds: A Damköhler number analysis](https://doi.org/10.1029/2021GB007278)

## Advancing global surface water monitoring
- How do we observe and monitor global surface water resources?
- What new hydrological understanding is revealed through these techniques (both remote and in situ)?
- **Representative papers:**
  - [Constraining remote river discharge estimation using reach-scale geomorphology](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020WR027949)
  - [Remotely sensing river greenhouse gas exchange velocity using the SWOT satellite](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022GB007419)
  - [A framework for estimating global river discharge from the surface water and ocean topography satellite mission](https://doi.org/10.1029/2021WR031614)
