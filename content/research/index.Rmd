Drainage networks are the arteries of the continents, an interconnected network of rivers, streams, lakes, wetlands, and more that drain the land surface and transport water and nutrients downstream. River science draws on hydrology, geomorphology, biogeochemistry, ecology, and engineering to take a broad approach to studying drainage networks and water resources.

My work is oriented by a single research question: “how could fundamental river science improve our understanding of global hydrology and inform our ability to sustainably manage freshwater resources?”. To do this, I (1) develop remote sensing, GIS, machine learning, and transport modeling techniques for river systems, (2) develop fundamental river science theory, and (3) work directly with field scientists and policy researchers to develop an integrated global assessment of hydrological transport processes.

## Measuring rivers from space
- What properties of global rivers can we measure using satellites?
- What new hydrological knowledge do these measurements reveal?
- **Representative papers:**
  - [Constraining remote river discharge estimation using reach-scale geomorphology](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020WR027949)
  - [Remotely sensing river greenhouse gas exchange velocity using the SWOT satellite](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022GB007419)
  - [A Framework for Estimating Global River Discharge From the Surface Water and Ocean Topography Satellite Mission](https://doi.org/10.1029/2021WR031614)

## Transporting 'stuff' downstream
- How do organic matter, pollutants, and other materials move through drainage systems?
- How does geomorphology and hydrology modulate downstream transport?

## Mapping the human footprint on global surface waters
- What is the role of human use, policy, and regulation on downstream waters?
- How far downstream are these impacts felt?
- **Representative papers:**
