## Global river remote sensing
- What properties of a river can we infer from satellite measurements?
- What first-order geomorphology can we learn from these measurements?
- How do they inform and help river transport simulations?

## River solute transport modeling
- How does CO2 and DOC move through drainage systems?
- How about other nutrients and/or pollutants?
- What roles do river size and lake/reservoir topology play in downstream carbon transport?

## Downstream impacts modeling
- What role do headwaters play in water quality?
- How to dams/reservoirs/levees/canals implicate downstream transport of water and solutes?
- What are the downstream impacts of pollution, wastewater effluent, forest organic matter, and more?

## Fundamental fluvial geomorphology
- What governs channel shape along river profiles from source to sea?
- How does theoretical advances in flow resistance and sediment transport equations influence broader global hydrology?
- Are river network scaling 'laws' emergent properties or statistically contrived?
