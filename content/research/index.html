<p>Drainage networks are the arteries of the continents, an interconnected network of rivers, streams, lakes, reservoirs, wetlands, and more that drain the land surface and transport water, nutrients, and other ‘stuff’ downstream or to the atmosphere. Sustainable management of global freshwater resources requires not only a knowledge of hydroclimatic processes across a range of scales, but also the tools (models, theories, and data) to explore potential solutions.</p>
<p>To achieve this, my work takes a broad approach to global hydrology. I develop and combine (1) remote sensing algorithms, (2) numerical transport models, (3) syntheses of large in situ databases, and (4) river science theories to better understand global water and nutrient cycling. I have a particular interest in bringing together environmental data science and high-performance computing with theories learned from dyed-in-the-wool field science, leveraging both perspectives simultaneously to facilitate new knowledge and solutions to global freshwater issues.</p>
<p><strong>Approaching global hydrology this way (through a lens of multidisciplinary, computational river science) provides a framework for taking the pulse of the world’s rivers for sustainable water resource management.</strong></p>
