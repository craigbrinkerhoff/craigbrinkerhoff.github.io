<div id="global-river-remote-sensing" class="section level2">
<h2>Global river remote sensing</h2>
<ul>
<li>What properties of a river can we infer from satellite measurements?</li>
<li>What first-order geomorphology can we learn from these measurements?</li>
<li>How do they inform and help river transport simulations?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="river-solute-transport-modeling" class="section level2">
<h2>River solute transport modeling</h2>
<ul>
<li>How does CO2 and DOC move through drainage systems?</li>
<li>How about other nutrients and/or pollutants?</li>
<li>What roles do river size and lake/reservoir topology play in downstream carbon transport?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="downstream-impacts-modeling" class="section level2">
<h2>Downstream impacts modeling</h2>
<ul>
<li>What role do headwaters play in water quality?</li>
<li>How to dams/reservoirs/levees/canals implicate downstream transport of water and solutes?</li>
<li>What are the downstream impacts of pollution, wastewater effluent, forest organic matter, and more?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="fundamental-fluvial-geomorphology" class="section level2">
<h2>Fundamental fluvial geomorphology</h2>
<ul>
<li>What governs channel shape along river profiles from source to sea?</li>
<li>How does theoretical advances in flow resistance and sediment transport equations influence broader global hydrology?</li>
<li>Are river network scaling ‘laws’ emergent properties or statistically contrived?</li>
</ul>
</div>
