<p>Drainage networks are the arteries of the continents, an interconnected network of rivers, streams, lakes, wetlands, and more that drain the land surface and transport water and nutrients downstream. River science draws on hydrology, geomorphology, geochemistry, ecology, and engineering to take a broad approach to studying drainage networks and water resources.</p>
<p>But what would river science look like globally? It is impossible to constrain hydrology using in situ sensors because we cannot install them in every river on Earth. An alternative is to measure large areas all at once using satellites to ‘fill in the gaps’, but they have varying spatial and temporal resolutions. And while numerical modeling may provide continuous simulations, these are not direct observations. Finally, despite much progress there is still a disconnect between our small-scale process understanding, its integration into global models, and the use of these models for water resources. All told, these limitations have downstream effects on what basic river science questions we can answer at scale, which in turn impedes our ability to address global freshwater resource issues.</p>
<p>My work reconciles this problem by integrating all the above approaches to answer a single research question: “how could fundamental river science improve our understanding of global hydrology and in turn our ability to sustainably manage freshwater resources?”. To do this, I (1) develop remote sensing, GIS, machine learning, and transport modeling techniques for river systems, (2) develop fundamental river science theory, and (3) work directly with field scientists and policy researchers to develop an integrated global assessment of hydrological phenomena.</p>
