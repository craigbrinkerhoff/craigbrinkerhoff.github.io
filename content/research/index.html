<p>Drainage networks are the arteries of the continents, an interconnected network of rivers, streams, lakes, reservoirs, wetlands, and more that drain the land surface and transport water, nutrients, and other ‘stuff’ downstream or to the atmosphere. Sustainable management of global freshwater resources requires not only a knowledge of hydroclimatic processes across a range of scales, but also the tools (models, computational frameworks, and river science theories) to explore potential solutions. To achieve this, my work takes a broad, cross-disciplinary approach to surface hydrology. I develop and combine (1) remote sensing algorithms, (2) numerical transport models, (3) syntheses of large in situ databases, and (4) river science theories to better understand global surface water and nutrient cycling. <strong>Approaching global hydrology this way (through the lens of multidisciplinary river science) provides a framework for taking the pulse of the world’s rivers to better inform water resources science and management.</strong></p>
