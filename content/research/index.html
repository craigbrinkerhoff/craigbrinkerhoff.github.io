<p>My work takes a broad, multi-tool approach to global hydrology. I do this across millions of rivers by leveraging and developing tools from hydrology, biogeochemistry, remote sensing, and large-scale geoprocessing. I’m particularly interested in what arises from simultaneously considering hydrology and biogeochemistry at large scales: <strong>how might a broad, ‘bio-geo-morpho-chemical’ approach reveal new knowledge about global surface water quantity and quality?</strong></p>
