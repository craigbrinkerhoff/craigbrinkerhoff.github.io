  abstract = {The Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission expected to launch in 2021 will offer a unique opportunity to map river discharge at an unprecedented spatial resolution globally from observations of water surface elevation, width, and slope. Because river discharge will not be directly observed from SWOT, a number of algorithms of varying complexity have been developed to estimate discharge from SWOT observables. Outstanding issues include the lack of accurate prior information and parameter equifinality. We developed a new data assimilation discharge algorithm that aimed to overcome these limitations by integrating a data-driven approach to estimate priors with a model informed by hydraulic geometry relations. A comprehensive simulated dataset of 18 rivers was used to evaluate the algorithm and four different configurations (rectangular channel, generic channel, and geomorphologically classified channel with and without regularization) to assess the impact of progressively adding hydraulic geometry constraints to the estimation problem. The algorithm with the full set of constraints outperformed the other configurations with median Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients of 0.77, compared with -0.46, 0.31 and 0.66, while other error metrics showed similar improvement. Results from this study show the promise of this hybrid data-driven approach to estimating river discharge from SWOT observations, although a number of enhancements need to be tested to improve the operational applicability of the algorithm.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in remote sensing and the upcoming launch of the joint NASA/CNES/CSA/UKSA Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite point toward improved river discharge estimates in ungauged basins. Existing discharge methods rely on ``prior river knowledge'' to infer parameters not directly measured from space. Here, we show that discharge estimation is improved by classifying and parameterizing rivers based on their unique geomorphology and hydraulics. Using over 370,000 in situ hydraulic observations as training data, we test unsupervised learning and an ``expert'' method to assign these hydraulics and geomorphology to rivers via remote sensing. This intervention, along with updates to model physics, constitutes a new method we term ``geoBAM,'' an update of the Bayesian At-many-stations hydraulic geometry-Manning's (BAM) algorithm. We tested geoBAM on Landsat imagery over more than 7,500 rivers (108 are gauged) in Canada's Mackenzie River basin and on simulated hydraulic data for 19 rivers that mimic SWOT observations without measurement error. geoBAM yielded considerable improvement over BAM, improving the median Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) for the Mackenzie River from -0.05 to 0.26 and from 0.16 to 0.46 for the SWOT rivers. Further, NSE improved by at least 0.10 in 78/108 gauged Mackenzie rivers and 8/19 SWOT rivers. We attribute geoBAM improvement to parameterizing rivers by type rather than globally, but prediction accuracy worsens if parameters are misassigned. This method is easily mapped to rivers at the global scale and paves the way for improving future discharge estimates, especially when coupled with hydrologic models.},

  abstract = {Lakes are central components of the inland water system distinct from, yet inextricably connected to, river networks. Currently, existing network-scale biogeochemistry research, although robust, typically treats each of these components separately or reductively. Here, we incorporate lake morphometry into a fully connected stream/lake network for the Connecticut River watershed and model potential evasion of terrestrially sourced headwater CO2 as transported through the network, ignoring in-stream production. We found that approximately 25\%--30\% of total potential soil CO2 evasion occurs in lakes, and percent evasion is inversely related to streamflow. A lake's ability to evade CO2 is controlled by residence time and size: most lakes with residence time over 7 days or surface area greater than 0.004 km2 evade functionally all terrestrial CO2 entering from upstream, precluding further downstream transport. We conclude that lakes are important for soil CO2 degassing and that this coupled river/lake approach is promising for CO2 studies henceforth.},

Here we present evidence, using United States Geological Survey field measurements of channel hydraulics for 155 rivers, that AMHG can be hydraulically and geomorphically reconciled with AHG. Our results indicate that AMHG is rightly understood as an expression of a river-wide model of hydraulics driven by changes in slope imposed upon AHG physics. The explanatory power of AHG and this river-wide model combine to determine whether AMHG exists: if both AHG and the river-wide model adequately describe hydraulics, then we show that AMHG is a necessary mathematical consequence of these two phenomena. We also orient these findings in the context of river discharge estimation and other applications.},

  abstract = {Two decades of research has shown that the global river network emits significant amounts of greenhouse gas. Despite much progress, there is still large uncertainty in the temporal dynamics of gas exchange and thus carbon emissions to the atmosphere. Much of this uncertainty stems from a lack of existing tools for studying the spatiotemporal dynamics of gas exchange velocity (the rate of this diffusive transport). We propose that the NASA/CNES/UKSA/CSA Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite can provide new insights to fluvial gas exchange modeling upon launch and subsequent data collection in 2022. Here, we exploit the distinct geomorphology of SWOT-observable rivers ({$>$}50 m wide) to develop a physical model of gas exchange that is remotely sensible and explains 50\% of log-transformed variation across 166 field measurements of . We then couple this model with established inversion techniques to develop BIKER, the ``Bayesian Inference of the Exchange Rate'' algorithm. We validate BIKER on 47 SWOT-simulated rivers without an in-situ calibration, yielding an algorithm that predicts the timeseries solely from SWOT observations with a by-river median Kling-Gupta Efficiency of 0.21. BIKER is better at inferring the temporal variation of gas exchange (median correlation coefficient of 0.91), than reproducing the absolute rates of exchange (median normalized RMSE of 51\%). Finally, BIKER is robust to measurement errors implicit in the SWOT data. We suggest that BIKER will be useful in mapping global-scale fluvial gas exchange and improving emissions estimates when coupled with river models.},

SWOT discharge products (available approximately 1 year after launch) will provide discharge for all river that reaches wider than 100 m. In this paper, we describe how SWOT discharge produced and archived by the US and French space agencies will be computed from measurements of river water surface elevation, width, and slope and ancillary data, along with expected discharge accuracy. We present for the first time a complete estimate of the SWOT discharge uncertainty budget, with separate terms for random (standard error) and systematic (bias) uncertainty components in river discharge time series. We expect that discharge uncertainty will be less than 30\% for two-thirds of global reaches and will be dominated by bias. Separate river discharge estimates will combine both SWOT and in situ data; these ``gage-constrained'' discharge estimates can be expected to have lower systematic uncertainty. Temporal variations in river discharge time series will be dominated by random error and are expected to be estimated within 15\% for nearly all reaches, allowing accurate inference of event flow dynamics globally, including in ungaged basins. We believe this level of accuracy lays the groundwork for SWOT to enable breakthroughs in global hydrologic science.},

SWOT observations will enable estimation of river discharge by using simple flow laws such as the Manning-Strickler equation, complementing in situ streamgages. Several discharge inversion algorithms designed to compute unobserved flow law parameters (e.g., friction coefficient and bathymetry) have been proposed, but to date, a systematic assessment of factors controlling algorithm performance has not been conducted. Here, we assess the performance of the five algorithms that are expected to be used in the construction of the SWOT product. To perform this assessment, we used synthetic SWOT observations created with hydraulic model output corrupted with SWOT-like error. Prior information provided to the algorithms was purposefully limited to an estimate of mean annual flow (MAF), designed to produce a ``worst case'' benchmark. Prior MAF error was an important control on algorithm performance, but discharge estimates produced by the algorithms are less biased than the MAF; thus, the discharge algorithms improve on the prior. We show for the first time that accuracy and frequency of remote sensing observations are less important than prior bias, hydraulic variability among reaches, and flow law accuracy in governing discharge algorithm performance. The discharge errors and error sensitivities reported herein are a bounding benchmark, representing worst possible expected errors and error sensitivities. This study lays the groundwork to develop predictive power of algorithm performance, and thus map the global distribution of worst-case SWOT discharge accuracy.},

  abstract = {Accurately estimating river discharge from satellite-derived river hydraulic variables (e.g., width, height, and slope) is the overarching goal of the remote sensing of discharge (RSQ) community. Numerous past studies have developed and intercompared different RSQ algorithms to demonstrate their feasibility, yet relatively few have focused on assessing how the RSQ algorithms are adapted to a wide range of rivers globally. As the community is now ready to expand to the global scale given advances in computing power, sensors, and the launch of the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission, a much broader geographic view of RSQ accuracy should be prioritized toward ``better generalizability'' instead of ``higher accuracy at limited places''. To help close this gap, we extracted multi-temporal river widths from {$>$}350~K Landsat scenes at {$>$}3~K river reaches globally, and used them to estimate discharge using the Bayesian AMHG-Manning (BAM) algorithm and the geomorphologically-enhanced variant (geoBAM). We use this framework to demonstrate how to apply an `off the shelf' RSQ algorithm and test it globally without methodological intervention and answer: does it live up to its promise? Our daily discharge inversions (1984--2019) showed positive Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) at 27\% of the gauges for BAM and 39\% for geoBAM, and this percentage increased to 46--65\% after feeding richer priors on flow seasonality and monthly variability, amounting to 1400--2000 successful inversions. Exploratory analyses showed that the inversion is the most sensitive to a channel geomorphological parameter b and climate aridity, where the optimal conditions are high-b, humid environments, as well as moderate width variability, leaf area index (LAI), and river width. Although specific to BAM/geoBAM, constraining the factors to their optimal ranges led to a median KGE of 0.33 for {$>$}600 gauges, which highlights the promising potential for global RSQ. We further discussed the optimal configuration of the RS/priors by analyzing results derived from different information content in priors. Overall, our critical assessment of BAM/geoBAM reveals a successful global implementation of an existing algorithm that SWOT will improve. We suggest similar large-scale assessments for other RSQs be prioritized to identify the emerging challenges as we move into a new era with global river monitoring capability from space.},

Removal efficiency depends on factors that affect either the reactivity or advection of a constituent within river networks. Here, we characterized Damk{\"o}hler number (Da) for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) uptake in global river networks. Da equals the advection to reaction timescale ratio and thus provides a unitless indicator for DOC reaction intensity during transport within river networks. We aim to demonstrate the spatial and temporal patterns and interplays among factors that determine DOC uptake across global river networks. We show that watershed size imposes a primary control on river network DOC uptake due to a three orders of magnitude difference in water residence time (WRT) between the smallest and largest river networks. DOC uptake capacity in tropical river networks is 2--6 times that in temperate and the Arctic river networks, coinciding with larger DOC removals in warm than in cold watersheds. River damming has a profound impact on DOC uptake due to significantly extended WRTs, particularly in temperate watersheds where most constructed dams are situated. Global warming is projected to increase river network DOC uptake by ca. 19\% until year 2100 under the RCP4.5 scenario.},

Global estimates of this flux are, however, uncertain, relying on calculated values for CO2 and lacking spatial accuracy or seasonal variations critical for understanding macroecosystem controls of the flux. Here, we compiled 5,910 direct measurements of fluvial CO2 partial pressure and modeled them against watershed properties to resolve reach-scale monthly variations of the flux. The direct measurements were then combined with seasonally resolved gas transfer velocity and river surface area estimates from a recent global hydrography dataset to constrain the flux at the monthly scale. Globally, fluvial CO2 emission varies between 112 and 209 Tg of carbon per month. The monthly flux varies much more in Arctic and northern temperate rivers than in tropical and southern temperate rivers (coefficient of variation: 46 to 95 vs. 6 to 12\%). Annual fluvial CO2 emission to terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) ratio is highly variable across regions, ranging from negligible ({$<$}0.2\%) to 18\%. Nonlinear regressions suggest a saturating increase in GPP and a nonsaturating, steeper increase in fluvial CO2 emission with discharge across regions, which leads to higher percentages of GPP being shunted into rivers for evasion in wetter regions. This highlights the importance of hydrology, in particular water throughput, in routing terrestrial carbon to the atmosphere via the global drainage networks. Our results suggest the need to account for the differential hydrological responses of terrestrial--atmospheric vs. fluvial--atmospheric carbon exchanges in plumbing the terrestrial carbon budget.},

The importance of complete photooxidation, or photomineralization, as a sink for DOC remains unclear in temperate rivers, as most estimates are restricted to lakes, high latitude rivers, and coastal river plumes. In this study, we construct a model representing over 75,000 river reaches in the Connecticut River Watershed (CRW), USA, to calculate spectrally resolved photomineralization. We test the hypothesis that photomineralization is a negligible DOC sink across all reaches and flow conditions relative to DOC fluxes. Our model quantifies reaction rates and transport drivers within the river reaches for the ranges of flow conditions, incoming solar irradiance, and canopy cover shading observed throughout the year. Our model predicts average daily areal photomineralization rates ranging from 1.16 mg-C m-2 day-1 in low flow river reaches in the winter, to 18.33 mg-C m-2 day-1 in high flow river reaches during the summer. Even for high photomineralization fluxes, corresponding photomineralization uptake velocities are typically at least an order of magnitude smaller than those reported for other instream processes. We calculate DOC elimination by photomineralization relative to DOC fluxes through individual stream reaches as well as the entire riverine portion of the CRW. We find that relative photomineralization fluxes are highest in summer drought conditions in low order streams. In median flows and mean light intensities, for an average watershed travel distance, 3\%--5\% of the DOC fluxes are eliminated, indicating that photomineralization is a minor DOC sink in temperate rivers.},

  abstract = {River networks transport dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from terrestrial uplands to the coastal ocean. The extent to which a reach or lake within a river network uptakes DOC depends on the stream order, the seasonal conditions, and the flow. At the watershed scale, it remains unclear whether DOC uptake is dominated by biological processes such as respiration, or abiotic processes like photomineralization. The partitioning of DOC uptake in lakes vs. rivers is also unclear. In this study, we present a new model that unifies year-round controls on DOC cycling for an entire river network, including river--lake connectivity, to elucidate the importance of biotic vs. abiotic controls on DOC uptake. We present the Catchment UPtake and Sinks by Season, Order, and Flow for DOC (CUPS-OF-DOC) model, which quantifies terrestrial DOC loading, gross primary productivity, and uptake via microbes and photomineralization. The model is applied to the Connecticut River Watershed, and accounts for cascading reach- and lake-scale DOC cycling across 98 scenarios spanning combinations of flows, seasons, and stream orders. We show that riverine DOC uptake is nearly constant with stream order, but the proportion of DOC uptake from photomineralization varies. Photomineralization dominates in rivers in most flow conditions and stream orders, especially in winter, accounting for at least half of whole-watershed DOC uptake in February across all flows. Whole-watershed summer DOC uptake occurs mostly via biomineralization in lakes, accounting for 80\% of DOC uptake during the growing season, despite accounting for less than 6\% of watershed open water surface area.},

  abstract = {Rivers and lakes are intrinsically connected waterbodies yet they are rarely used to hydrologically constrain one another with remote sensing. Here we begin to bridge the gap between river and lake hydrology with the introduction of the LakeFlow algorithm. LakeFlow uses river-lake mass conservation and observations from the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite to provide river discharge estimates of lake and reservoir inflows and outflows. We test LakeFlow performance at three lakes using a synthetic SWOT data set assuming the maximum measurement errors defined by the mission science requirements, and we include modeled lateral inflow and lake evaporation data to further constrain the mass balance. We find that LakeFlow produces promising discharge estimates (median Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency = 0.88, relative bias = 14\%). LakeFlow can inform water resources management by providing global lake inflow and outflow estimates, highlighting a path for recognizing rivers and lakes as an interconnected system.},
