<p><a href="https://github.com/craigbrinkerhoff/BIKER/"><code>BIKER</code></a> (“Bayesian Inference of the K600 Evasion Rate”) enables inference of the normalized riverine gas exchange velocity from measurements of river surface width and height/slope. It does so using Bayesian inference and a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler to generate a posterior distribution for a gas exchange model. <code>BIKER</code> was developed in the context of the upcoming <a href="https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/overview/">NASA/CNES SWOT mission</a>.</p>
