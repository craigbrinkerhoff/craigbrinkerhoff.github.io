<p><a href="https://github.com/craigbrinkerhoff/geoBAMr/"><code>geoBAMr</code></a> An update to <a href="https://github.com/markwh/bamr"><code>bamr</code></a> that uses more geomorphically-informed prior knowledge for discharge inversion.</p>
<p>From <code>bamr</code>: “The bamr package facilitates Bayesian AMHG + Manning discharge estimation using stream slope, width, and partial cross-section area. It includes functions to preprocess and visualize data, perform Bayesian inference using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (via models pre-written in the Stan language), and analyze the results.”</p>
<p><code>geoBAMr</code> expands upon this project by defining prior river knowledge using river classification frameworks. Internal to <code>geoBAMr</code>, geomorphic river types are assigned to rivers using stream widths, which in turn determine which priors are fed into the BAM algorithm. <code>geoBAMr</code> uses the identical Bayesian model as used in <code>bamr</code>.</p>
