I'm a PhD candidate and a computational hydrologist interested in global surface water quantity and quality. I use and develop remote sensing, in situ sensing, geomorphic scaling, and river transport modeling to measure water/solute transport through the worldâ€™s drainage systems. A unique component of my work is bringing together ideas from river hydrology, geomorphology, and limnology within large computing projects. See my [Research](/research/) page for more details!!
