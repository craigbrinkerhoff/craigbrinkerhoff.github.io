My name is Craig Brinkerhoff and I am a PhD candidate in the [Fluvial@UMass group](https://blogs.umass.edu/cjgleason/) in Civil & Environmental Engineering at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. I'm a computational fluvial hydrologist interested in the downstream impacts of the landscape (and people) on global water quantity and quality.
<br><br>

In practice, I use and develop 1) novel remote sensing algorithms, 2) geomorphic scaling theory, 3) numerical river transport models, and 4) in situ sensor networks to map, measure, and monitor water/solute transport through the worldâ€™s drainage systems. A unique component of my work is leveraging the long and rich tradition of fieldwork in fluvial geomorphology and hydrology within large computing projects.
